# PagerDuty Incident Extension

PagerDuty Incident Checker is a tool for PagerDuty's users. This chrome extension allows them to quickly check the most recent incidents recorded with their current status and time stamp. In addition, it has a lookup feature that searches for an event based on its incident number.  

PagerDuty Incident Check adds value to the end user by providing the convenience of quick checks on the status of recent incidents without having to navigate to PagerDuty's account and dashboard platform. This will encourage team members to stay updated with new incidents and its statuses across the board.
